Overview of the Project:

This project is a Simple Quiz Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application consists of a single question displayed to the user, with three multiple-choice options.
The project is divided into three main parts: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, each contributing to the overall functionality and presentation.

### **1. HTML Structure**
The HTML provides the content and structure of the quiz:
- **Header**: Displays the quiz title.
- **Question Section**: Contains the question and a list of options with radio buttons for user selection.
- **Submit Button**: Allows the user to submit their answer.
- **Result Section**: A hidden area that displays feedback after submission.



### **2. CSS Structure**
The CSS styles the quiz, ensuring a user-friendly appearance:
- **Body**: Sets the font, background color, and overall alignment.
- **Container**: Provides a centered, styled card layout with padding, rounded corners, and shadows.
- **Question and Options**: Ensures the content is readable and well-spaced.
- **Button Styling**: Adds color, hover effects, and rounded edges for an interactive feel.



### **3. JavaScript Structure**
The JavaScript adds interactivity and logic:
- **Correct Answer Validation**: Checks if the selected answer matches the correct answer (`"Mars"`).
- **Feedback Display**: Shows a success message for correct answers or prompts users to try again for incorrect ones.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user if no option is selected.
